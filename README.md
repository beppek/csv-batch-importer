# CSV BATCH IMPORTER

CLI which imports orders from a CSV file to a MongoDB database.

## Getting started

**This project depends on a running, local instance of MongoDB.**

Run `npm i` and once the packages have installed start the CLI with `npm start`. The CLI will prompt for the absolute path to the CSV file. _Please note that relative paths also work_. You can navigate to the path as you normally would in the terminal, using tab for autocompletion. The CLI accepts file input pointing to a CSV file anywhere in the file system that the current user has access to.

## Tests

You can run the tests for the project with `npm test`.
